This is cache simulator
This includes LRU, FIFO and optimal replacement for replacements.
This also includes the concept of write-back, inclusive and so on.


To do
For the replacement, the block should be array since it is hardware simulator.
The reason why I used list is that it is easier to find least recent or first come. However, the hardware can't change the order of blocks.
